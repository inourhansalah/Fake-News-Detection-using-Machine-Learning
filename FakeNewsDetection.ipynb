(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo African-American voters, vowing to restore law and order, only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence. Speaking a few miles from Milwaukee, which was rocked by weekend riots, Trump accused his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of \\u201cbigotry\\u201d and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants. Trump has been repeatedly called a \\u201cbigot\\u201d by his Democratic opponents. \\u201cI\\u2019m asking for the vote for every African-American citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cJobs, safety, opportunity, fair and equal representation: We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to, and talks down to, communities of color and sees them only as votes \\u2013 that\\u2019s all they care about \\u2013 not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.\\u201d Earlier, Trump held three events in Milwaukee, a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of Sylville Smith, 23. Authorities said Smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it.  Trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city, including some at a closed fundraiser. He held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Inspector Edward Bailey. But news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions.  Clarke, who is black and spoke at last month\\u2019s Republican National Convention, has criticized the protests, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that they were \\u201ca collapse of the social order, where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge.\\u201d Trump also taped a town hall meeting with Fox News, in which he blamed President Barack Obama for what he sees as hostility toward police. \\u201cHe has not been good to the police, simply, and the police are not big fans of his,\\u201d Trump said. Trump traveled 45 minutes outside of Milwaukee, which is 40 percent black, to deliver his appeal to African-American voters in the suburb of West Bend, Wisconsin, a community that is 95 percent white. He spoke before an almost entirely white audience.  \\u201cA vote for her (Clinton) is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cCrime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a Trump administration.\\u201d  Clinton won the Democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state, including overwhelming support from African-Americans in the South. \\u201cWith each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what\\u2019s true of himself,\\u201d Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. \\u201cWhen people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. \\u201cNow he\\u2019s accusing her of bigoted remarks - we think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge.\\u201d Trump also took aim at Clinton\\u2019s past acceptance of large speaking fees, saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office. Police violence against African-Americans has set off intermittent, sometimes violent protests in the past two years, igniting a national debate over race and policing in the United States and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump said critics of the police \\u201cshare in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and other places in our country.\\u201d \\u201cThe war on our police must end and it must end now,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cThe war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens.\\u201d The shooting of Smith was likely justified, Trump argued in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning. \\u201cBut the gun was pointed at his (a police officer\\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\\u2019s what the narrative is,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\\u2019t be rioting.\\u201d  Officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence are expected to give Trump a briefing on national security issues this week, an adviser to Trump and a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination, which Trump did last month. Hillary Clinton, Trump\\u2019s Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one. Democrats have criticized Trump\\u2019s positions on foreign policy and national security, besides some freewheeling remarks. Democratic President Barack Obama has called Trump \\u201cunfit\\u201d for the presidency and this month warned the Republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret. \",\n          \"(Reuters) - Momentum in Germany is building for a new  grand coalition  between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) to end the political instability created by the collapse of her coalition talks with other parties. The conservatives and SPD have ruled together for the last four years and most ministers are keeping their posts in an interim government until a new coalition or minority government is formed. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier hosts a first meeting of Merkel, the head of Bavaria s CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, and SPD leader Martin Schulz on Thursday.  Here are some of the overlaps and differences in policy areas likely to be discussed in any coalition talks. Merkel has stressed she wants to maintain Germany s solid finances. Germany has run a budget surplus since 2014 under the stewardship of her hardline conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. She has also said she wants some tax cuts, mainly for low and medium earners.  The SPD is far more focused on boosting spending and has in the last few days said it wants to increase investment in education and homes as well as on infrastructure. The SPD wants to increase inheritance tax, some in the party want to insist on raising the minimum wage and it fought the election on a pledge of keeping pensions stable.  The conservatives and SPD both want to increase spending to expand broadband.  An area of possible conflict. Since the election, Merkel has bowed to pressure from her Bavarian allies to put a cap on the number of people Germany will accept on humanitarian grounds. Merkel repeated on Saturday that she wanted to limit the number to about 200,000 a year.  The SPD opposes this, arguing it breaches the constitution s guarantee of asylum to people who are persecuted for political reasons. Some leading party members have said they will not agree to a cap. The SPD is more positive than Merkel s cautious stance towards French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals for a euro zone budget and a euro zone finance minister. The SPD also backs the idea of turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund along the lines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  There is little difference on approach to Brexit talks. Broad agreement on most areas of foreign policy, including with the United States and Turkey. The SPD puts greater emphasis on mending ties with Russia which have been hurt by the conflict in Ukraine, but this is more a matter of nuance than a deep policy rift. Also agreement on armed forces missions abroad although the SPD is more skeptical on NATO demands to move towards increasing defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2014. The SPD fought its election on the platform of social justice and wants to improve the lot of the less affluent. A long-standing commitment which several senior SPD members have repeated recently is the idea of making health insurance fairer for everyone by introducing a  citizen s insurance . The SPD also wants to ensure men and women have equal pay and working conditions.  \",\n          \"There are many important issues in the world: racism, discrimination, poverty, police brutality. Unfortunately, Republicans   issue of the week,  while it touches on one of those in all the worst ways, is something so unimportant, so petty, that Americans are actually paying attention to the plight of transgender individuals for once.All across the nation, the GOP is focused on making sure that no one with a penis enters a women s restroom, even if they identify as a woman. Kansas, for example, literally wants to place a bounty on transgender individuals with its  spot a penis, win a prize bill, which provides financial incentives for people who simply share a bathroom with a transgender individual to childishly scream  Eek, a penis! Republicans in other states   Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina, and others, are attempting to punish transgender people simply for using the correct restroom while North Carolina and Mississippi, for example, have already passed legislation that punish women who happen to have a penis (let s face it: they aren t concerned with trans men) for going pee.Not to be outdone by the other bigots in our country, one Texas city has thrown itself into the fray with a  bathroom bill  that would levy huge fines against transgender people   though they are attempting a new approach to the matter by claiming that it doesn t target transgender individuals.Now, you may be shaking your head at his point and asking,  F*cking SERIOUSLY?  But we assure you it s true.The New Civil Rights Movement reports:Transgender people could face fines of up to $500 for using restrooms according to their gender identity under an ordinance to be considered by the City Council in Rockwall, Texas, on Monday.The ordinance, submitted by Rockwall Mayor Jim Pruitt (photo), would require people to use restrooms according to their  biological sex,  as shown on their birth certificates. It would also bar businesses from allowing trans people to use restrooms according to their gender identity. I just think that it s insanity not to have those protections in place,  Pruitt, a Republican, told WFAA-TV.  These folks aren t transgender that this is targeting. This is targeting folks of the opposite sex that are going into those restrooms under the guise of being transgender and having access.  This is not about sexual orientation or anything of that nature. It is about privacy and the protection of our children. Republicans love to claim that they are protecting women and children with these obviously discriminatory pieces of legislation but the truth is that there isn t a single verifiable instance of a transgender individual so much as harassing a non-transgender person in a bathroom. None. Nada. Zilch. In fact, if they truly wanted to protect women and children in bathrooms, Republican lawmakers would ban Republican lawmakers from entering bathrooms at all.At this point, everyone needs to recognize these bills for what they are. They keep no one safe. They do not prevent crime. They do not protect women or children. They do not make sense when one looks at crime statistics. What they do is perpetuate a culture of hate and fear among the poorly-educated and bigoted in society. They increase the chance that women   cisgender or trans   will be harassed by stupid people who think they don t look feminine enough. They do nothing but promote exactly the sort of mentality that reasonable people have been trying to eliminate every single time conservatives find a new group of people at whom they can level their irrational hatred.But they do accomplish one positive thing: They bring attention to the plight of a group of people who regularly face discrimination, yet whose cries for help are ignored.Watch one example of the sort of nonsense this legislation encourages below:  Featured image via Tumblr\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \" claimed that hundreds of alternative media websites were producing  fake news  and  conspiracy  stories and therefore were unreliable as information sources.

(Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Tuesday delivered his most aggressive call yet to woo African-American voters, vowing to restore law and order, only days after a fatal police shooting of a black man sparked more street violence. Speaking a few miles from Milwaukee, which was rocked by weekend riots, Trump accused his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton of \\u201cbigotry\\u201d and vowed to protect the jobs of minorities from immigrants. Trump has been repeatedly called a \\u201cbigot\\u201d by his Democratic opponents. \\u201cI\\u2019m asking for the vote for every African-American citizen struggling in our society today who wants a different and much better future,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cJobs, safety, opportunity, fair and equal representation: We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to, and talks down to, communities of color and sees them only as votes \\u2013 that\\u2019s all they care about \\u2013 not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.\\u201d Earlier, Trump held three events in Milwaukee, a city still reeling from violent protests after the death of Sylville Smith, 23. Authorities said Smith was stopped for acting suspiciously and was shot by police because he was carrying an illegal handgun and refused orders to drop it.  Trump encountered only a handful of peaceful protesters while in the city, including some at a closed fundraiser. He held a brief meeting with veterans and law enforcement, including Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke and Inspector Edward Bailey. But news media representatives were escorted out and not permitted to hear the discussions.  Clarke, who is black and spoke at last month\\u2019s Republican National Convention, has criticized the protests, writing in an opinion piece for The Hill that they were \\u201ca collapse of the social order, where tribal behavior leads to reacting to circumstances instead of waiting for facts to emerge.\\u201d Trump also taped a town hall meeting with Fox News, in which he blamed President Barack Obama for what he sees as hostility toward police. \\u201cHe has not been good to the police, simply, and the police are not big fans of his,\\u201d Trump said. Trump traveled 45 minutes outside of Milwaukee, which is 40 percent black, to deliver his appeal to African-American voters in the suburb of West Bend, Wisconsin, a community that is 95 percent white. He spoke before an almost entirely white audience.  \\u201cA vote for her (Clinton) is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime and lost opportunities,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cCrime and violence is an attack on the poor and it will never be accepted in a Trump administration.\\u201d  Clinton won the Democratic nomination in part thanks to her large victory margins among minorities in nearly every state, including overwhelming support from African-Americans in the South. \\u201cWith each passing Trump attack, it becomes clearer that his strategy is just to say about Hillary Clinton what\\u2019s true of himself,\\u201d Clinton spokeswoman Jennifer Palmieri said. \\u201cWhen people started saying he was temperamentally unfit, he called Hillary the same. When his ties to the Kremlin came under scrutiny, he absurdly claimed that Hillary was the one who was too close to Putin. \\u201cNow he\\u2019s accusing her of bigoted remarks - we think the American people will know which candidate is guilty of the charge.\\u201d Trump also took aim at Clinton\\u2019s past acceptance of large speaking fees, saying he would force top administration officials to sign a pledge not to accept speaking fees from corporations with registered lobbyists or foreign countries for five years after leaving office. Police violence against African-Americans has set off intermittent, sometimes violent protests in the past two years, igniting a national debate over race and policing in the United States and giving rise to the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump said critics of the police \\u201cshare in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee and other places in our country.\\u201d \\u201cThe war on our police must end and it must end now,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cThe war on police is a war against all peaceful citizens.\\u201d The shooting of Smith was likely justified, Trump argued in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday morning. \\u201cBut the gun was pointed at his (a police officer\\u2019s) head, supposedly ready to be fired. Who can have a problem with that? That\\u2019s what the narrative is,\\u201d Trump said. \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s not true. If it is true, people shouldn\\u2019t be rioting.\\u201d  Officials from the Office of Director of National Intelligence are expected to give Trump a briefing on national security issues this week, an adviser to Trump and a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Presidential candidates are entitled to a briefing of classified information after formally securing the nomination, which Trump did last month. Hillary Clinton, Trump\\u2019s Democratic rival for the Nov. 8 election, is also entitled to receive a briefing if she requests one. Democrats have criticized Trump\\u2019s positions on foreign policy and national security, besides some freewheeling remarks. Democratic President Barack Obama has called Trump \\u201cunfit\\u201d for the presidency and this month warned the Republican candidate that briefing information must be kept secret. \",\n          \"(Reuters) - Momentum in Germany is building for a new  grand coalition  between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservative bloc and the Social Democrats (SPD) to end the political instability created by the collapse of her coalition talks with other parties. The conservatives and SPD have ruled together for the last four years and most ministers are keeping their posts in an interim government until a new coalition or minority government is formed. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier hosts a first meeting of Merkel, the head of Bavaria s CSU conservatives, Horst Seehofer, and SPD leader Martin Schulz on Thursday.  Here are some of the overlaps and differences in policy areas likely to be discussed in any coalition talks. Merkel has stressed she wants to maintain Germany s solid finances. Germany has run a budget surplus since 2014 under the stewardship of her hardline conservative finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble. She has also said she wants some tax cuts, mainly for low and medium earners.  The SPD is far more focused on boosting spending and has in the last few days said it wants to increase investment in education and homes as well as on infrastructure. The SPD wants to increase inheritance tax, some in the party want to insist on raising the minimum wage and it fought the election on a pledge of keeping pensions stable.  The conservatives and SPD both want to increase spending to expand broadband.  An area of possible conflict. Since the election, Merkel has bowed to pressure from her Bavarian allies to put a cap on the number of people Germany will accept on humanitarian grounds. Merkel repeated on Saturday that she wanted to limit the number to about 200,000 a year.  The SPD opposes this, arguing it breaches the constitution s guarantee of asylum to people who are persecuted for political reasons. Some leading party members have said they will not agree to a cap. The SPD is more positive than Merkel s cautious stance towards French President Emmanuel Macron s proposals for a euro zone budget and a euro zone finance minister. The SPD also backs the idea of turning the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund into a European Monetary Fund along the lines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  There is little difference on approach to Brexit talks. Broad agreement on most areas of foreign policy, including with the United States and Turkey. The SPD puts greater emphasis on mending ties with Russia which have been hurt by the conflict in Ukraine, but this is more a matter of nuance than a deep policy rift. Also agreement on armed forces missions abroad although the SPD is more skeptical on NATO demands to move towards increasing defense spending to 2 percent of gross domestic product by 2014. The SPD fought its election on the platform of social justice and wants to improve the lot of the less affluent. A long-standing commitment which several senior SPD members have repeated recently is the idea of making health insurance fairer for everyone by introducing a  citizen s insurance . The SPD also wants to ensure men and women have equal pay and working conditions.  \",\n          \"There are many important issues in the world: racism, discrimination, poverty, police brutality. Unfortunately, Republicans   issue of the week,  while it touches on one of those in all the worst ways, is something so unimportant, so petty, that Americans are actually paying attention to the plight of transgender individuals for once.All across the nation, the GOP is focused on making sure that no one with a penis enters a women s restroom, even if they identify as a woman. Kansas, for example, literally wants to place a bounty on transgender individuals with its  spot a penis, win a prize bill, which provides financial incentives for people who simply share a bathroom with a transgender individual to childishly scream  Eek, a penis! Republicans in other states   Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, and South Carolina, and others, are attempting to punish transgender people simply for using the correct restroom while North Carolina and Mississippi, for example, have already passed legislation that punish women who happen to have a penis (let s face it: they aren t concerned with trans men) for going pee.Not to be outdone by the other bigots in our country, one Texas city has thrown itself into the fray with a  bathroom bill  that would levy huge fines against transgender people   though they are attempting a new approach to the matter by claiming that it doesn t target transgender individuals.Now, you may be shaking your head at his point and asking,  F*cking SERIOUSLY?  But we assure you it s true.The New Civil Rights Movement reports:Transgender people could face fines of up to $500 for using restrooms according to their gender identity under an ordinance to be considered by the City Council in Rockwall, Texas, on Monday.The ordinance, submitted by Rockwall Mayor Jim Pruitt (photo), would require people to use restrooms according to their  biological sex,  as shown on their birth certificates. It would also bar businesses from allowing trans people to use restrooms according to their gender identity. I just think that it s insanity not to have those protections in place,  Pruitt, a Republican, told WFAA-TV.  These folks aren t transgender that this is targeting. This is targeting folks of the opposite sex that are going into those restrooms under the guise of being transgender and having access.  This is not about sexual orientation or anything of that nature. It is about privacy and the protection of our children. Republicans love to claim that they are protecting women and children with these obviously discriminatory pieces of legislation but the truth is that there isn t a single verifiable instance of a transgender individual so much as harassing a non-transgender person in a bathroom. None. Nada. Zilch. In fact, if they truly wanted to protect women and children in bathrooms, Republican lawmakers would ban Republican lawmakers from entering bathrooms at all.At this point, everyone needs to recognize these bills for what they are. They keep no one safe. They do not prevent crime. They do not protect women or children. They do not make sense when one looks at crime statistics. What they do is perpetuate a culture of hate and fear among the poorly-educated and bigoted in society. They increase the chance that women   cisgender or trans   will be harassed by stupid people who think they don t look feminine enough. They do nothing but promote exactly the sort of mentality that reasonable people have been trying to eliminate every single time conservatives find a new group of people at whom they can level their irrational hatred.But they do accomplish one positive thing: They bring attention to the plight of a group of people who regularly face discrimination, yet whose cries for help are ignored.Watch one example of the sort of nonsense this legislation encourages below:  Featured image via Tumblr\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \" claimed that hundreds of alternative media websites were producing  fake news  and  conspiracy  stories and therefore were unreliable as information sources.

Despite weeks of exploratory discussion, Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens remain far apart on climate, immigration and energy policy, and they disagree on where the blame lies for the lack of progress.  For me it is clear that on the subject of finances the question is how we can use the room for maneuver (in the budget) so that everybody can have their priorities implemented while at the same time ensure that we have a balanced budget,  Merkel said in a video message on Facebook.  On the subject of climate protection, challenging goals for 2020 that we undertook as federal government under my leadership are not so simple to meet,  she added, shortly before a meeting with other party leaders to try to nudge the talks forward.  The theme that is especially important for us is the issue of immigration and integration,  she said.  These will be difficult issues.  Party leaders are hoping for a sharper focus on policy detail to reinvigorate negotiations that have barely inched forward since a national election in September. Merkel said she wanted the exploratory talks to end on Nov. 16 after which the parties can launch proper negotiations that can conclude with a coalition agreement. The FDP and Greens blame each other for the lack of real progress.  By dragging their foot on climate protection, the FDP are playing into the hands of climate change deniers like (U.S. President Donald) Trump,  Greens party chair Simone Peter told a news conference.  The lack of seriousness has to stop.  But Greens co-leader Cem Oezdemir signaled in an interview with the Stuttgarter Zeitung that the ecologist party would be ready to relent on its insistence that the next government commit to removing all combustion engines from roads by 2030.  It s clear to me that we alone would not be able to insist that 2030 will be the year when combustion engines are no longer,  he said. The Greens wanted instead a  clear commitment  that the cars of the future are emissions-free, he added. FDP leader Christian Lindner said the hard work of finding common ground was only now beginning.  There haven t been attempts to build bridges in the past two weeks because that wasn t the purpose,  he said.  We look forward in this phase to moving from outlines to the facts and goals that need to be harmonized - or not, as the case may be.  Senior Greens complain that talks have been hamstrung by the FDP s lack of preparedness. After a four-year absence from the federal parliament, the FDP lacks the policy expertise needed to negotiate the compromises that are needed, Green officials say. But Lindner said he opposed the Greens  desire to  make an example of industrial Germany  by forcing it to meet expensive and constraining climate protection targets, and he suggested Germany could have a greater impact on the climate by helping other countries to improve their emissions record. For Merkel, the awkward three-way negotiations, forced on her after her conservative bloc shed votes in the election, represents her best chance of securing a fourth term in office, with many believing failure would oblige her to stand aside. With her former coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), determined to go into opposition after a disastrous election, Germany could face a lengthy period of drift at a time when many in Europe look to Berlin for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to trans-Atlantic ties.

The police are attempting to rescue the four people, who were taken by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 13, said Andrew Aniamaka, a spokesman for Delta state police.  Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have, in the last few years, been kidnapped in the Niger Delta region, which holds most of the country s crude oil - the country s economic mainstay.     The abductors have not made any contact but we are doing our investigations to know the motive and have them rescued without jeopardising their lives,  said Aniamaka.  Information available to us shows they are missionaries giving free medical services,  he said, adding that the British nationals had been working in a very rural area. There was an increase in crime in the southern region last year that coincided with a series of attacks on energy facilities. However, there have been no militant attacks on energy installations so far this year. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Orders for a Bernie Sanders action figure, complete with the U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful\\u2019s signature slouch, open mouth and accusatory pointed finger, were flooding in from fans on Thursday, months ahead of the toy\\u2019s delivery date in July. Brooklyn product design company FCTRY created a prototype for the 6-inch (15-cm) tall plastic version of the Vermont senator and started a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of raising $15,000 to fund production. Within 24 hours of the campaign\\u2019s debut on Wednesday, FCTRY  had raised about $40,000 from fans snapping up various deals, including a sold-out $20 offer for a single Bernie Sanders action figure called \\u201cThe Early Bern Special #1.\\u201d The company has also sold 20,000 Hillary Clinton action figures depicting the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential hopeful in a sky blue pant suit. It previously sold 200,000 President Barack Obama action figures, said FCTRY Chief Executive Jason Feinberg. \\u201cIf you buy one of our action figures, whether it\\u2019s Hillary or now Bernie, we\\u2019ll donate $1 from that sale online to their actual campaign,\\u201d Feinberg said. \\u201cThe idea is to have a way where regular people can sort of easily participate in campaign donations through a small business.\\u201d A prototype of the Bernie Sanders action figure was created by Seattle pop-artist Mike Leavitt and will be mass produced overseas, Feinberg said. The figures are expected to be ready in July, the same month as the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when Clinton and Sanders face off as the party chooses its nominee for U.S. president and vice president for the November national election. The company has no plans to turn New York real estate developer Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or any of the other Republican White House contenders into toys. \\u201cIn 2008, we were sort of compelled to make a (Senator John) McCain and it\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve always regretted so there were no Republicans this time,\\u201d Feinberg said.  Among the pre-order deals available online is \\u201cThe Full Ticket,\\u201d which includes a single Bernie Sanders action figure plus a single Hillary Clinton action figure. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just sayin. Crazier things have happened,\\u201d the Kickstarter site notes. A Sanders spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Despite weeks of exploratory discussion, Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the Greens remain far apart on climate, immigration and energy policy, and they disagree on where the blame lies for the lack of progress.  For me it is clear that on the subject of finances the question is how we can use the room for maneuver (in the budget) so that everybody can have their priorities implemented while at the same time ensure that we have a balanced budget,  Merkel said in a video message on Facebook.  On the subject of climate protection, challenging goals for 2020 that we undertook as federal government under my leadership are not so simple to meet,  she added, shortly before a meeting with other party leaders to try to nudge the talks forward.  The theme that is especially important for us is the issue of immigration and integration,  she said.  These will be difficult issues.  Party leaders are hoping for a sharper focus on policy detail to reinvigorate negotiations that have barely inched forward since a national election in September. Merkel said she wanted the exploratory talks to end on Nov. 16 after which the parties can launch proper negotiations that can conclude with a coalition agreement. The FDP and Greens blame each other for the lack of real progress.  By dragging their foot on climate protection, the FDP are playing into the hands of climate change deniers like (U.S. President Donald) Trump,  Greens party chair Simone Peter told a news conference.  The lack of seriousness has to stop.  But Greens co-leader Cem Oezdemir signaled in an interview with the Stuttgarter Zeitung that the ecologist party would be ready to relent on its insistence that the next government commit to removing all combustion engines from roads by 2030.  It s clear to me that we alone would not be able to insist that 2030 will be the year when combustion engines are no longer,  he said. The Greens wanted instead a  clear commitment  that the cars of the future are emissions-free, he added. FDP leader Christian Lindner said the hard work of finding common ground was only now beginning.  There haven t been attempts to build bridges in the past two weeks because that wasn t the purpose,  he said.  We look forward in this phase to moving from outlines to the facts and goals that need to be harmonized - or not, as the case may be.  Senior Greens complain that talks have been hamstrung by the FDP s lack of preparedness. After a four-year absence from the federal parliament, the FDP lacks the policy expertise needed to negotiate the compromises that are needed, Green officials say. But Lindner said he opposed the Greens  desire to  make an example of industrial Germany  by forcing it to meet expensive and constraining climate protection targets, and he suggested Germany could have a greater impact on the climate by helping other countries to improve their emissions record. For Merkel, the awkward three-way negotiations, forced on her after her conservative bloc shed votes in the election, represents her best chance of securing a fourth term in office, with many believing failure would oblige her to stand aside. With her former coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), determined to go into opposition after a disastrous election, Germany could face a lengthy period of drift at a time when many in Europe look to Berlin for leadership on issues ranging from euro zone governance to trans-Atlantic ties.

The police are attempting to rescue the four people, who were taken by unidentified gunmen on Oct. 13, said Andrew Aniamaka, a spokesman for Delta state police.  Kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of Nigeria. A number of foreigners have, in the last few years, been kidnapped in the Niger Delta region, which holds most of the country s crude oil - the country s economic mainstay.     The abductors have not made any contact but we are doing our investigations to know the motive and have them rescued without jeopardising their lives,  said Aniamaka.  Information available to us shows they are missionaries giving free medical services,  he said, adding that the British nationals had been working in a very rural area. There was an increase in crime in the southern region last year that coincided with a series of attacks on energy facilities. However, there have been no militant attacks on energy installations so far this year. \",\n          \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Orders for a Bernie Sanders action figure, complete with the U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful\\u2019s signature slouch, open mouth and accusatory pointed finger, were flooding in from fans on Thursday, months ahead of the toy\\u2019s delivery date in July. Brooklyn product design company FCTRY created a prototype for the 6-inch (15-cm) tall plastic version of the Vermont senator and started a Kickstarter campaign with a goal of raising $15,000 to fund production. Within 24 hours of the campaign\\u2019s debut on Wednesday, FCTRY  had raised about $40,000 from fans snapping up various deals, including a sold-out $20 offer for a single Bernie Sanders action figure called \\u201cThe Early Bern Special #1.\\u201d The company has also sold 20,000 Hillary Clinton action figures depicting the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential hopeful in a sky blue pant suit. It previously sold 200,000 President Barack Obama action figures, said FCTRY Chief Executive Jason Feinberg. \\u201cIf you buy one of our action figures, whether it\\u2019s Hillary or now Bernie, we\\u2019ll donate $1 from that sale online to their actual campaign,\\u201d Feinberg said. \\u201cThe idea is to have a way where regular people can sort of easily participate in campaign donations through a small business.\\u201d A prototype of the Bernie Sanders action figure was created by Seattle pop-artist Mike Leavitt and will be mass produced overseas, Feinberg said. The figures are expected to be ready in July, the same month as the 2016 Democratic National Convention, when Clinton and Sanders face off as the party chooses its nominee for U.S. president and vice president for the November national election. The company has no plans to turn New York real estate developer Donald Trump, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida or any of the other Republican White House contenders into toys. \\u201cIn 2008, we were sort of compelled to make a (Senator John) McCain and it\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve always regretted so there were no Republicans this time,\\u201d Feinberg said.  Among the pre-order deals available online is \\u201cThe Full Ticket,\\u201d which includes a single Bernie Sanders action figure plus a single Hillary Clinton action figure. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just sayin. Crazier things have happened,\\u201d the Kickstarter site notes. A Sanders spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The relief in European capitals lasted barely a day as reports surfaced of a White House plan to oust the U.S. secretary of state, plunging America\\u2019s friends back into confusion over President Donald Trump\\u2019s foreign policy. The uncertainty is particularly acute given Washington\\u2019s leading role in crises in North Korea and Syria. \\u201cJust as Tillerson comes to Brussels to give a public statement of support that the EU and NATO have wanted all along, it seems he has no mandate, that the guillotine is hanging over his head,\\u201d said an EU official involved in diplomacy with White House officials. \\u201cIt leaves Europe just as doubtful as before about Trump.\\u201d U.S. officials said on Thursday the White House had a plan for CIA Director Mike Pompeo to replace Tillerson but Trump said on Friday he was not leaving and the secretary of state said on Saturday the reports were untrue. European leaders yearn for stability in U.S. foreign policy. They are troubled by Trump\\u2019s \\u201cAmerica first\\u201d rhetoric and inconsistent statements on NATO and the European Union. In addition, Trump\\u2019s decision to pull out of the Paris climate change accord and his decision not to certify Iran\\u2019s compliance with a nuclear deal undermine European priorities. \\u201cThe chaos in the administration doesn\\u2019t help in the current geopolitical climate,\\u201d said a senior French diplomat. Early last week, Tillerson, a former Exxon Mobil chief executive, delivered a long address in support of Europe in Washington more akin to traditional U.S. policy. \\u201cThe United States remains committed to our enduring relationship with Europe. Our security commitments to European allies are ironclad,\\u201d he told a think tank.  He said he would convey that message to the European Union and NATO. He is set to visit Brussels on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in Vienna on Thursday and Paris on Friday. The question is whether European officials believe him, given tensions during his April visit to Europe, when Reuters reported Tillerson initially planned to skip a NATO meeting in Brussels and then only attended under pressure from allies. \\u201cIf there were expectations that Tillerson might evolve into a counterweight to Trump, someone who could pass on messages from partners and exert moderating influence over American foreign policy \\u2013 those expectations have been disappointed,\\u201d said Niels Annen, foreign policy spokesman for Germany\\u2019s Social Democrats in parliament. \\u201cOn his watch, the State Department has become a non-actor.\\u201d Despite Tillerson\\u2019s pledge to reform the U.S. foreign service, European governments take a dim view of how he has sought to cut costs at the State Department, with top diplomatic posts unfilled almost a year into the administration.  The French have gone around Tillerson to develop contacts with U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, White House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, while the EU\\u2019s top diplomat Federica Mogherini has gone directly to Vice President Mike Pence. Berlin has focused on Capitol Hill, as well as Kelly, McMaster and Mattis. Yet it is unclear if that access translates into a direct impact on Trump\\u2019s foreign policy, diplomats said. There is hope that if Pompeo is appointed he could rejuvenate the State Department after Tillerson, who is seen as ineffective, diplomats said. Pompeo is an unknown quantity in Europe but is viewed as closer to Trump. \\u201cWe may be looking at a larger dose of Trump at the State Department,\\u201d if Pompeo did get the job, said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, head of the German Marshall Fund\\u2019s Berlin office. One European diplomat said Tillerson was in a difficult position from the outset because the Trump administration was hostile to Iran and brought in a team of generals who took a hard line, \\u201cso it never left Tillerson much room.\\u201d In addition, Trump\\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner has taken a leading role in formulating policy on Middle East peace. But Europeans see Trump as a blizzard of conflicting signals. At a NATO summit in Brussels in May, the president publicly admonished European leaders for their low defense spending and threatened to reduce support, only to announce a jump in U.S. military spending in Europe months later. Things may only become more unpredictable, diplomats say. European diplomats see Tillerson and Mattis as instrumental in talking Trump out of making any rash decisions over North Korea and its nuclear program, given administration comments about \\u201cutterly destroying\\u201d the country. \",\n          \"On December 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks bravely defied a bus driver s orders to give her seat to a white person and move to the back of the bus. Parks  refusal is remembered as one of the greatest moments in civil rights history and, unfortunately, history has a way of repeating itself. Now, a California lawsuit has many comparing a San Fransisco woman to Rosa Parks   with very good reason.Toni Young was traveling via Greyhound to a family celebration in Sacramento. The African-American woman sat at the front of a bus driven by Caucasian lady Cynthia Lara. The driver explained to Young that she was expecting an elderly woman to board once they reached Sacramento   Young s destination   and that she would need to move to the back of the bus.Young explained that she would be getting off the bus in Sacramento, and that the seat would be available when it was needed. This was not good enough for Lara, however, and she insisted that Young move, complaining that the woman was far too uppity. Young  quietly  complied, but her attorney, Michael Adams, explains: My client quietly said to her,  You don t have to have an attitude about this . Lara then   loudly asserted that she did not have any attitude  and called for security to remove Young from the bus in Oakland. At that point, Young says Lara  loudly muttered  a racial slur. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says. Young then had to wait several hours for another bus. While she awaited her new transportation, she asked for paperwork to file a complaint, but was told Greyhound was out of the forms. She requested to speak to a manager, but was informed none were available.Young eventually reached Sacramento, but the family celebration had ended by the time she arrived. It was the most dehumanizing incident of my life,  explained Young.  I will never ride a Greyhound bus again. Young says she suffers from psychological trauma, including post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety. She is seeking punitive damages from the company. It was shocking to me that we have an incident like this reminiscent of the Rosa Parks incident many years ago,  Adams says, pointing to an incident last year when a group of African-American women were kicked off a Napa Valley Wine Train for  laughing while black. Society seems to be backsliding,  he says.Sadly, he is right. After all, Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee.Featured image via Raw Story\",\n          \"The folks at Fox News are getting crazier on a minute by minute basis and although it s quite sad that this organization calls itself a news outlet, it s nonetheless quite entertaining watching Fox eat its own.In the latest of her rants, so-called   judge  and Donald Trump supporter Jeanine Pirro is ticked off at her cohort at Fox, nut-job extraordinaire Karl Rove and Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus  for their recent statements about a contested Republican convention and Donald Trump.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qINfdIhqzXM]Pirro usually reserves her outrageous statements for Democrats or Muslims, but this time she unleashed her fury on Rove and Priebus for their perceived anti-Trump stances. In response to Rove s suggestion that it would be acceptable for the Republicans to take the nomination away from Trump, even if he goes into the convention with the most delegates but not enough to secure the nomination, unhinged the Fox contributor. She said: The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, is still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, it s now   at a time when more people than ever are invested and voting. You want to keep your status quo   the one where one hand washes the other, and we pay for the soap. Pirro also reacted to Rove s remarks where he said a  fresh face  may be needed to beat Clinton in November. Pirro said: You want a fresh face? Aren t you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? Continuing on her tangent, Pirro also attacked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, calling him out for refusing to tell Sean Hannity  whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote-getters   Trump or Cruz. Pirro said: Whatever happened to  your vote matters?  Not only is that infuriating, it is un-American. Watching all of these so-called conservatives and Republicans implode before our very eyes comes at just the right time as we head into the elections for November because it helps clarify that the GOP of today should not be in charge of this country.

Pressure is mounting on regulators and Silicon Valley companies to open up the opaque world of online political ads and to prevent governments from using them to sway elections or attempt other meddling.  \\u201cSocial media platforms offer the ability to target millions of users based upon a wealth of highly detailed information,\\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the election commission.  \\u201cAs we have seen, the low cost of reaching these users equips hostile foreign actors with a powerful new tool for disruption of our democratic process.\\u201d  Some 20 Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives signed the letter.  Facebook, the world\\u2019s largest social network, said this month that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of Facebook ads promoting divisive messages before and after last year\\u2019s U.S. presidential election.  Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating the allegations.     The Federal Election Commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes, and the commission is considering holding a public hearing, with Facebook and other tech companies as invited witnesses.  Facebook has said it is working with U.S. authorities who are investigating alleged Russian meddling and also taking steps, such as removing fake accounts, to prevent manipulation of its platform.      \",\n          \"If you didn t think Republicans could stoop any lower, think again.Because if they have their way, there will be a state law in Washington that will guarantee that even our private body parts no longer remain private.In their effort to persecute transgender people, Washington state Republicans have chosen to push legislation that would force everyone to show their genitalia before they are allowed to use a bathroom.According to Pink News,Senate bill 6548 would amend equality legislation to state:  Nothing in this chapter grants any right to a person to access a private facility segregated by gender, such as a bathroom, restroom, toilet, shower, locker room, or sauna, of a public or private entity if the person is preoperative, nonoperative, or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated. And because the bill solely relies  on the presence of genitalia  to determine who can use which bathroom, it means girls and boys would have to show their vaginas and penises to whatever stranger is guarding the bathroom in order to be let in.Imagine going to a library, a theme park, a theater, a business, or even school and having to stand in line for the bathroom with the horrifying thought that some strange person is going to have to examine you below the belt to determine which bathroom you can use. It s sounds pretty damn embarrassing, not to mention cruel.But this is the strategy Republicans have come up with to discriminate against transgender people.The same kind of perverted legislation has already been proposed in VirginiaThat bill was strongly blasted by civil rights advocate Tim Peacock: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections). Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Sarah Warbelow called the Washington bill urged people to demand that the bill be killed. We urge all fair-minded people across the state to demand their lawmakers immediately stop these offensive assaults on fairness and equality, and we call on the Senate to vote down these dangerous measures if they come to a vote on the floor. Republicans might as well announce to pedophiles everywhere that this is their chance to legally examine the private parts of children, because that s what this bill basically does. An adult would be required to look at the private parts of children to determine which bathroom they can use so that a transgender child doesn t use what conservatives claim is the wrong bathroom.It s not hard to see that if this bill passes the lawsuits are going to pile up and clog our judicial system even more than it already is. It s also not hard to see that this is a conservative dream come true, and it s a sick dream at that.Featured Image: Pixabay\",\n          \"The topic of climate change is somehow still being debated even though it s fact vs. fiction. Climate change is very real, and when 97 percent of scientists agree, we should probably believe them. Yet, there are still people who like to push the narrative that it is a myth. People like former half-term Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin.Well, on Monday s broadcast of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel tore apart her denial in an absolutely brilliant way. He showed a clip of her denying climate change where she said, Oh, well, if 97 percent of all scientists believe that man s activities are creating changes in the weather, who am I to question that? This is when Kimmel was blunt and to the point: Exactly. Who are you to question that? Over the past few weeks Palin has been trying really hard to be relevant again and pushing the narrative that she knows better than scientists. However, Kimmel shuts her down in one sentence.Kimmel stated: We ve had 15 of the 16 hottest years ever since 2001. That s not an opinion. It s a fact. Adding: For some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue. The politicians debate it. Our scientists don t. A huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening. They say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us. There s no debate about the greenhouse effect, just like there s no debate about gravity. It someone throws a piano off the roof, I don t care what Sarah Palin tells you, get out of the way. It s coming down on your head. He then shows a video of actual climate scientists telling us that climate change is, in fact, very real, and why would they make something like this up. Because seriously, what benefit does that do besides change human activity to respect the planet better? Those telling us it s not real are the ones who have more to lose, because big polluters derive profit from destroying the earth. They don t want us to believe climate change is actually happening, and they ve been paying big money to spread their false narrative so they can keep polluting.Kimmel means business, and simply states either you believe science or you don t. He also knows that he s going to get a massive amount of negative feedback by those who insist climate change isn t real because they re either paying to get that message out there or they re dumb enough to believe it.Climate change shouldn t be a left or right issue. The earth and its climate are not up for debate   it s science. Denying it exists only makes one look like a fool. Good on Kimmel for getting serious and getting real about this very real problem that we need to combat sooner rather than later before it s too late.Watch the clip here:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-03-31 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2018-02-19 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1008,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-04-09 00:00:00\",\n          \"2017-03-19 00:00:00\",\n          \"2017-08-12 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4987729971020631,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Pressure is mounting on regulators and Silicon Valley companies to open up the opaque world of online political ads and to prevent governments from using them to sway elections or attempt other meddling.  \\u201cSocial media platforms offer the ability to target millions of users based upon a wealth of highly detailed information,\\u201d the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the election commission.  \\u201cAs we have seen, the low cost of reaching these users equips hostile foreign actors with a powerful new tool for disruption of our democratic process.\\u201d  Some 20 Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives signed the letter.  Facebook, the world\\u2019s largest social network, said this month that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of Facebook ads promoting divisive messages before and after last year\\u2019s U.S. presidential election.  Russia has denied meddling in the U.S. election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton. U.S. congressional committees and special counsel Robert Mueller are investigating the allegations.     The Federal Election Commission last week sought public comment on possible regulatory changes, and the commission is considering holding a public hearing, with Facebook and other tech companies as invited witnesses.  Facebook has said it is working with U.S. authorities who are investigating alleged Russian meddling and also taking steps, such as removing fake accounts, to prevent manipulation of its platform.      \",\n          \"If you didn t think Republicans could stoop any lower, think again.Because if they have their way, there will be a state law in Washington that will guarantee that even our private body parts no longer remain private.In their effort to persecute transgender people, Washington state Republicans have chosen to push legislation that would force everyone to show their genitalia before they are allowed to use a bathroom.According to Pink News,Senate bill 6548 would amend equality legislation to state:  Nothing in this chapter grants any right to a person to access a private facility segregated by gender, such as a bathroom, restroom, toilet, shower, locker room, or sauna, of a public or private entity if the person is preoperative, nonoperative, or otherwise has genitalia of a different gender from that for which the facility is segregated. And because the bill solely relies  on the presence of genitalia  to determine who can use which bathroom, it means girls and boys would have to show their vaginas and penises to whatever stranger is guarding the bathroom in order to be let in.Imagine going to a library, a theme park, a theater, a business, or even school and having to stand in line for the bathroom with the horrifying thought that some strange person is going to have to examine you below the belt to determine which bathroom you can use. It s sounds pretty damn embarrassing, not to mention cruel.But this is the strategy Republicans have come up with to discriminate against transgender people.The same kind of perverted legislation has already been proposed in VirginiaThat bill was strongly blasted by civil rights advocate Tim Peacock: This is what the conservative movement has devolved into: forcing children to allow adults to examine their genitals out of misplaced fear that transgender kids and adults might commit a hypothetical never-before-seen act of violence or sexual aggression (that would still be against the law with or without transgender protections). Human Rights Campaign spokesperson Sarah Warbelow called the Washington bill urged people to demand that the bill be killed. We urge all fair-minded people across the state to demand their lawmakers immediately stop these offensive assaults on fairness and equality, and we call on the Senate to vote down these dangerous measures if they come to a vote on the floor. Republicans might as well announce to pedophiles everywhere that this is their chance to legally examine the private parts of children, because that s what this bill basically does. An adult would be required to look at the private parts of children to determine which bathroom they can use so that a transgender child doesn t use what conservatives claim is the wrong bathroom.It s not hard to see that if this bill passes the lawsuits are going to pile up and clog our judicial system even more than it already is. It s also not hard to see that this is a conservative dream come true, and it s a sick dream at that.Featured Image: Pixabay\",\n          \"The topic of climate change is somehow still being debated even though it s fact vs. fiction. Climate change is very real, and when 97 percent of scientists agree, we should probably believe them. Yet, there are still people who like to push the narrative that it is a myth. People like former half-term Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin.Well, on Monday s broadcast of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Kimmel tore apart her denial in an absolutely brilliant way. He showed a clip of her denying climate change where she said, Oh, well, if 97 percent of all scientists believe that man s activities are creating changes in the weather, who am I to question that? This is when Kimmel was blunt and to the point: Exactly. Who are you to question that? Over the past few weeks Palin has been trying really hard to be relevant again and pushing the narrative that she knows better than scientists. However, Kimmel shuts her down in one sentence.Kimmel stated: We ve had 15 of the 16 hottest years ever since 2001. That s not an opinion. It s a fact. Adding: For some reason whether or not humans are contributing to this has become a left versus right issue. The politicians debate it. Our scientists don t. A huge majority of climate scientists say climate change is happening. They say we re causing it and we need to do something about it before it has a terrible effect on all of us. There s no debate about the greenhouse effect, just like there s no debate about gravity. It someone throws a piano off the roof, I don t care what Sarah Palin tells you, get out of the way. It s coming down on your head. He then shows a video of actual climate scientists telling us that climate change is, in fact, very real, and why would they make something like this up. Because seriously, what benefit does that do besides change human activity to respect the planet better? Those telling us it s not real are the ones who have more to lose, because big polluters derive profit from destroying the earth. They don t want us to believe climate change is actually happening, and they ve been paying big money to spread their false narrative so they can keep polluting.Kimmel means business, and simply states either you believe science or you don t. He also knows that he s going to get a massive amount of negative feedback by those who insist climate change isn t real because they re either paying to get that message out there or they re dumb enough to believe it.Climate change shouldn t be a left or right issue. The earth and its climate are not up for debate   it s science. Denying it exists only makes one look like a fool. Good on Kimmel for getting serious and getting real about this very real problem that we need to combat sooner rather than later before it s too late.Watch the clip here:Featured image via video screen capture\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"worldnews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2015-03-31 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2018-02-19 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1008,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2015-04-09 00:00:00\",\n          \"2017-03-19 00:00:00\",\n          \"2017-08-12 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.4987729971020631,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1.0,\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_range\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 15,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 16,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The force - which will eventually comprise nearly 5,000 troops units from Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mauritania - is meant to counter a growing jihadist threat in West Africa s arid Sahel region that includes groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State. The U.S. support for the G5 force falls short of an expectation by France and others that Washington would back direct funding from the United Nations.  We believe that the G5 force must be, first and foremost, owned by the countries of the region themselves,  said the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley in remarks to the Security Council, following news of the new cash commitment.  We expect that the G5 countries will take on full regional ownership of the force within a period of three to six years, with continued U.S. engagement,  she said. A non-U.S. Security Council diplomat said, however, the U.S. is keen on continuing to look for some kind of direct U.N. involvement in supporting the G5 force. An ambush by unidentified militants this month in Niger killed four U.S. Special Forces troops and threw a spotlight on American involvement in counter-terrorism operations in the region.  The funds pledge, which must now be discussed with Congress, will bolster the U.S. s regional partners in their fight against Islamic State and other terrorist networks, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in the statement. Washington is wary of funding the G5 through the United Nations at a time when the Trump administration is aiming to cut U.N. expenditures on peacekeeping operations around the world, and has indicated it prefers to support the force on a bilateral basis. The G5 countries have set a first-year operating budget of just under $500 million, and about a quarter of that was committed before the U.S. announcement. A donors conference will be held in Brussels in mid December. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump\\u2019s nominee to be U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, said on Tuesday he is  \\u201cawaiting instructions\\u201d from Trump on whether to support a restoration of the Export-Import Bank\\u2019s full lending powers. The U.S. government trade bank\\u2019s loans have been capped at $10 million for more than a year because it has too few board members, with Republican opponents to the bank blocking recent nominees. The cap means that EXIM cannot finance the largest export U.S. products such as Boeing Co aircraft or Westinghouse nuclear reactors. Asked by Senator Maria Cantwell at his confirmation hearing whether he supports nominating new board members at the bank as part of a broad trade strategy aimed at reducing U.S. trade deficits and boosting exports, Lighthizer said that decision would ultimately be up to Trump. \\u201cI expect to do what the president instructs me to do when he instructs me to do it,\\u201d said Lighthizer, a former USTR deputy in the Reagan administration and a steel industry trade lawyer. Conservative Republicans in Congress have tried to kill EXIM because they view it as providing unnecessary \\u201ccorporate welfare\\u201d and putting U.S. taxpayers at risk for foreign projects.   \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"US_News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 828,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"6-Sep-15\",\n          \"1-Oct-17\",\n          \"27-Sep-16\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
